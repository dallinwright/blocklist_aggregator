The scope of this serverless application is to create a service that can determine whether an IP address is allowed or not based on this source: https://github.com/firehol/blocklist-ipsets.

Self-update whenever there are new entries in https://github.com/firehol/blocklist-ipsets. No human intervention should be required, and should be able to reply very fast.
